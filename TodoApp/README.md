<h1>TodoList App</h1>
The TodoList app is a beautifully designed and responsive task management application built entirely with React. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, providing a seamless user experience. The app stores task data in JSON format, eliminating the need for a database. To start the app, run the following command in your command line:

css
Copy code
npx json-server --port 8000 --watch data/db.json
This command will start a JSON server on port 8000 and watch the db.json file for data. Make sure you have the json-server package installed globally before running the command.

Feel free to customize it further to fit your preferences and style. :)
