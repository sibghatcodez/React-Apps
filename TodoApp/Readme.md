<h1>TodoList App</h1>

The TodoList app is a beautifully designed and responsive task management application built entirely with React. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, providing a seamless user experience. The app stores task data in JSON format, eliminating the need for a database. This project showcases my first solo endeavor with React and serves as a foundation for future web development projects.

- Feel free to customize it further to fit your preferences and style. :)
